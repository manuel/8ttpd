* CANCELLED

Server-side JavaScript (SSJS) outside of a virtual machine with a
large library is a waste of time.

Old description follows:

* WHAT

8ttpd is (well, will be) a JavaScriptable HTTP server using libevent
and V8, that basically follows (well, will follow) the Rack webserver
interface.

Early release! It's Sunday evening, I'm tired, and I don't know any C++...

* BUILD

g++ -levent 8ttpd.cc /path/to/libv8.a -o 8ttpd

(for some reason doesn't work with -lv8)

* RUN

8ttpd sample.js

Goto to http://localhost:8080

* MORE

libevent: http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/
      V8: http://code.google.com/p/v8/
    Rack: http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/files/SPEC.html
